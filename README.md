# Omniwheel - printable design

![A 3D CAD render of a simple omni wheel](cad_render.png)

This is a design for an [omniwheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_wheel) that can be 3D printed with a cheap hobby printer.

The design was created for use with the [Pimoroni Micro Metal Motor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/micro-metal-gearmotor-extended-back-shaft?variant=39421592043603) so has a 3mm hub hole.

To assemble one wheel you will need:

* 10 x rollers (printable part) recommend TPU
* 2 x hub sides (printable part) recommend PETG
* 10 x 28mm M2.5 Pan head screw (I used [Westfield A2 stainless Torx head](https://www.westfieldfasteners.co.uk/Bolts_Screws_Metric/Torx_Pan_Screw_M2.5x28_A2_Stainless.html))
* 10 x M2.5 narrow nyloc nuts (I used [Westfield DIN985 nut](https://www.westfieldfasteners.co.uk/Metric_Nuts/Nyloc_Nut_Type_T_Thin_M2.5_A2_Stainless.html))
* 1 x M3 square nut (for the grub screw)
* 1 x M3 grub screw
* 3 (or up to 10) x M3 x 20 machine screws
* 3 (or up to 10) x M3 full nut

Print two of he hub sides and place them back to back but offset by one through hole so that the rollers alternate between the sides.  Use the M3 x 20 bolts to secure the two sides together.  Fit the rollers one at a time with the M2.5 x 28 screws and nyloc nuts.  Finally push the square M3 nut into the hole and secure the wheel to an axel with an M3 grub screw.
